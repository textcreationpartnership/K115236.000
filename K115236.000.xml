            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF it is required to eſtabliſh a plantation of Madder, to which plants muſt be brought from a foreign country, they muſt be winter plants, which are pieces of the main root on which are many buds; theſe are to be had in the latter end of autumn or ſpring, when the crop is taken up. The beſt method is to pack them in ſand, as the buds will ſhoot; the ground ſhould be extremely rich, a ſandy loom, and perfectly clean; furrows ſhould be made about a foot aſunder and about four inches deep; ſtrew the pieces of root and any of the yellow ſhoots, that are broken off, juſt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0990400400:4"/>
to cover the bottom, and earth them. In the month of April there will appear numberleſs ſhoots, which ſhould be kept very clean, and a little fine mould thrown over them to lengthen the ſtem, which are the ſpring plants; when the ſhoots are about ſix or eight inches above ground, they are fit to draw, but care muſt be taken to pull them up with as long a ſtem as poſſible, as that becomes the principal part of the crop; the earth muſt be looſened by an old trowel or any ſuch like inſtrument to facilitate the drawing of the plants, but it muſt be done with care, as in a few days time there will be a freſh ſucceſſion of plants like aſparagus. The above are merely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the nurſery, which may be dug up for crop when all the plants are obtained; for the repeated pulling will ſo weaken the roots, as to render them not worth ſtanding for crop; for want of this precaution many people injure their crop by drawing plants from it, inſtead of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſmall patch as above deſcribed for a nurſery. It muſt likewiſe be obſerved, that you will obtain the longeſt and beſt plants from the firſt year's growth, as the original plant or mother root is much deeper, than the crowns of the plants will be by earthing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0990400400:5"/>
The land for the crop ſhould be as for the nurſery a rich mellow loam, either hazle, or black; it cannot be too rich, and muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly clean; it muſt be ploughed as deep as the good ſoil will admit of the preceding year of planting. Soil, that will not admit of ploughing eighteen inches deep at leaſt, is not fit for madder. It muſt be laid up in high four feet lands before winter, that it may be ſufficiently dry for working in the ſpring; for unleſs the land is in exceeding good tilth when you plant, it is in vain to attempt it.</p>

The madder muſt be frequently turned, and will be dry enough for grinding in twenty four hours. The firſt time, that it goes under the ſtones, requires but a few minutes; it muſt be ſifted and produces a very inferior ſpecies, which is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward coat or rind. The remainder is returned to the ſtones, and is kept there till the eye tells you that the interior part begins to grind, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers itſelf by the paleneſs of the colour. If you require the beſt ſort to be very fine, you continue this ſecond grinding a little longer, in ſhort till all the rind is pulled off; it muſt be then ſifted, and the remainder put again under the ſtones and ground till fine enough for uſe. Each ſort ſhould be caſked up ſeparately, and kept in a dry place where no moiſture can affect it; care ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be taken to preſs the madder well down in the caſks.</p>
            <p>There are various ſorts of madder differing greatly from each other both in appearance, and value. The ſort I prefer is the Turkey, being more vigorous, and of a darker green. It like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe produces abundance of ſeed, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort does not; it puts out many vigorous and ſolid runners, whereas the runners of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0990400400:11"/>
ſpecies are hollow, and produce none of the beſt part of the madder, which is contained in the woody part of the root.</p>
            <p>My mills conſiſted of two vertical ſtones, that run on a bed ſtone, ſuch as they uſe for grinding gunpowder, dye woods &amp;c.</p>
